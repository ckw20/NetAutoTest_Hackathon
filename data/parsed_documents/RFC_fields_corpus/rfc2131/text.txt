2. Protocol Summary

   From the client's point of view, DHCP is an extension of the BOOTP
   mechanism.  This behavior allows existing BOOTP clients to
   interoperate with DHCP servers without requiring any change to the
   clients' initialization software.  RFC 1542 [2] details the
   interactions between BOOTP and DHCP clients and servers [9].  There
   are some new, optional transactions that optimize the interaction
   between DHCP clients and servers that are described in sections 3 and
   4.

   Figure 1 gives the format of a DHCP message and table 1 describes
   each of the fields in the DHCP message.  The numbers in parentheses
   indicate the size of each field in octets.  The names for the fields
   given in the figure will be used throughout this document to refer to
   the fields in DHCP messages.

   There are two primary differences between DHCP and BOOTP.  First,
   DHCP defines mechanisms through which clients can be assigned a
   network address for a finite lease, allowing for serial reassignment
   of network addresses to different clients.  Second, DHCP provides the
   mechanism for a client to acquire all of the IP configuration
   parameters that it needs in order to operate.

   DHCP introduces a small change in terminology intended to clarify the
   meaning of one of the fields.  What was the "vendor extensions" field
   in BOOTP has been re-named the "options" field in DHCP. Similarly,
   the tagged data items that were used inside the BOOTP "vendor
   extensions" field, which were formerly referred to as "vendor
   extensions," are now termed simply "options."

                  Figure 1:  Format of a DHCP message

   DHCP defines a new 'client identifier' option that is used to pass an
   explicit client identifier to a DHCP server.  This change eliminates
   the overloading of the 'chaddr' field in BOOTP messages, where
   'chaddr' is used both as a hardware address for transmission of BOOTP
   reply messages and as a client identifier.  The 'client identifier'
   is an opaque key, not to be interpreted by the server; for example,
   the 'client identifier' may contain a hardware address, identical to
   the contents of the 'chaddr' field, or it may contain another type of
   identifier, such as a DNS name.  The 'client identifier' chosen by a
   DHCP client MUST be unique to that client within the subnet to which
   the client is attached. If the client uses a 'client identifier' in
   one message, it MUST use that same identifier in all subsequent
   messages, to ensure that all servers correctly identify the client.

   DHCP clarifies the interpretation of the 'siaddr' field as the
   address of the server to use in the next step of the client's
   bootstrap process.  A DHCP server may return its own address in the
   'siaddr' field, if the server is prepared to supply the next
   bootstrap service (e.g., delivery of an operating system executable
   image).  A DHCP server always returns its own address in the 'server
   identifier' option.

           Table 1:  Description of fields in a DHCP message

   The 'options' field is now variable length. A DHCP client must be
   prepared to receive DHCP messages with an 'options' field of at least
   length 312 octets.  This requirement implies that a DHCP client must
   be prepared to receive a message of up to 576 octets, the minimum IP
   datagram size an IP host must be prepared to accept [3].  DHCP
   clients may negotiate the use of larger DHCP messages through the
   'maximum DHCP message size' option.  The options field may be further
   extended into the 'file' and 'sname' fields.

   In the case of a client using DHCP for initial configuration (before
   the client's TCP/IP software has been completely configured), DHCP
   requires creative use of the client's TCP/IP software and liberal
   interpretation of RFC 1122.  The TCP/IP software SHOULD accept and
   forward to the IP layer any IP packets delivered to the client's
   hardware address before the IP address is configured; DHCP servers
   and BOOTP relay agents may not be able to deliver DHCP messages to
   clients that cannot accept hardware unicast datagrams before the
   TCP/IP software is configured.

   To work around some clients that cannot accept IP unicast datagrams
   before the TCP/IP software is configured as discussed in the previous
   paragraph, DHCP uses the 'flags' field [21].  The leftmost bit is
   defined as the BROADCAST (B) flag.  The semantics of this flag are
   discussed in section 4.1 of this document.  The remaining bits of the
   flags field are reserved for future use.  They MUST be set to zero by
   clients and ignored by servers and relay agents.  Figure 2 gives the
   format of the 'flags' field.
