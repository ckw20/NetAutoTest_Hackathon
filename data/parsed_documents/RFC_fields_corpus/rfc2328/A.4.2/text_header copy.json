The constraints have been updated based on the RFC document to include additional details about the unique identification of LSAs using LS type, Link State ID, and Advertising Router, as well as the maintenance of the most up-to-date LSA instance in the database. New constraints were added regarding the use of the Link Data field in determining next hop IP addresses for Point-to-MultiPoint networks and the role of links pointing back to the calculating router in such cases. Additionally, the TOS field now includes detailed encoding rules and mappings to RFC 1349 TOS values as specified in Section 12.3 of the OSPF specification."
