A.4.1 The LSA header

    All LSAs begin with a common 20 byte header.  This header contains
    enough information to uniquely identify the LSA (LS type, Link State
    ID, and Advertising Router).  Multiple instances of the LSA may
    exist in the routing domain at the same time.  It is then necessary
    to determine which instance is more recent.  This is accomplished by
    examining the LS age, LS sequence number and LS checksum fields that
    are also contained in the LSA header.

    LS age
        The time in seconds since the LSA was originated.

    Options
        The optional capabilities supported by the described portion of
        the routing domain.  OSPF's optional capabilities are documented
        in Section A.2.

    LS type
        The type of the LSA.  Each LSA type has a separate advertisement
        format.  The LSA types defined in this memo are as follows (see
        Section 12.1.3 for further explanation):




                        LS Type   Description
                        ___________________________________
                        1         Router-LSAs
                        2         Network-LSAs
                        3         Summary-LSAs (IP network)
                        4         Summary-LSAs (ASBR)
                        5         AS-external-LSAs




    Link State ID
        This field identifies the portion of the internet environment
        that is being described by the LSA.  The contents of this field
        depend on the LSA's LS type.  For example, in network-LSAs the
        Link State ID is set to the IP interface address of the
        network's Designated Router (from which the network's IP address
        can be derived).  The Link State ID is further discussed in
        Section 12.1.4.

    Advertising Router
        The Router ID of the router that originated the LSA.  For
        example, in network-LSAs this field is equal to the Router ID of
        the network's Designated Router.

    LS sequence number
        Detects old or duplicate LSAs.  Successive instances of an LSA
        are given successive LS sequence numbers.  See Section 12.1.6
        for more details.

    LS checksum
        The Fletcher checksum of the complete contents of the LSA,
        including the LSA header but excluding the LS age field. See
        Section 12.1.7 for more details.

    length
        The length in bytes of the LSA.  This includes the 20 byte LSA
        header.
